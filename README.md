# Bad Cookie

Unfortunately, it has become harder and harder to collect user data, with many users selfishly choosing to opt out of cookie tracking. This is a collection of examples meant to be integrated into any website to reduce the rate of users opting out of "optional" tracking.

## Todo:
* Add slight delay to Switcher?
* Adjust the dimensions for Mail
* Add button that "runs away" from your mouse
* Ask users to read terms and conditions that just scroll for forever (use overflow: hidden)
* Endless managing menus
