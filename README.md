# Bad Cookie

Unfortunately, it has become harder and harder to collect user data, with many users selfishly choosing to opt out of cookie tracking. This is a collection of examples meant to be integrated into any website to reduce the rate of users opting out of "optional" tracking.

## Todo:
* Add slight delay to Switcher
* Add button that moves and goes faster the closer your move your mouse
* Simple dialogue asking you to mail notice to some address
* Ask users to read terms and conditions that just scroll for forever
* Endless managing menus
* Very long list of cookies with checkboxes
